# simple-GAN
An example of a Generative Adversarial Network doing simple things

This project came from reading Ian Goodfellow's [original paper on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661).
I wanted to try to create the plots in Figure 1, which show a GAN learning how to create the normal 
distribution.

I hope that seeing the simplest possible GAN in action helps people understand some of the
underlying theory.
